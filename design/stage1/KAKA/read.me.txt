Files included in kaka:

	read.me		this file
	binout.c	source file for binout.exe
	binout.exe 	exe file compiled for DOS
	key.book	text file which contains 512 bit key

What binout.exe does?

	Reads key from key.book (16 lines, each line one int).

	Generates binout.32 binary file which contains 32 bit unsigned integers.
	Size is over 10Mb which is requirement for DIEHARD tests and can be used
	for ENT as well.

	On the end key.book is updated with last sequence of the keys from the generator,
	which means next time generator will produce different stream.

How to use binout.exe?

	Just type binout and make sure that key.book is in the same directory, after while
	binout.32 will apear in the directory.
