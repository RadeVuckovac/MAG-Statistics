Entropy = 7.999985 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 11466000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 11466000 samples is 236.28, and randomly
would exceed this value 75.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4865 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.139374150 (error 0.07 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000101 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
