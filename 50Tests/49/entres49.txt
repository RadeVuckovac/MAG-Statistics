Entropy = 7.999986 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 11466000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 11466000 samples is 221.10, and randomly
would exceed this value 90.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4849 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.140203035 (error 0.04 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000538 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
