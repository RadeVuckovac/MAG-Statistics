Entropy = 7.999984 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 11340000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 11340000 samples is 252.65, and randomly
would exceed this value 50.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4994 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.142419048 (error 0.03 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000560 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
