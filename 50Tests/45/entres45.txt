Entropy = 7.999984 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 11466000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 11466000 samples is 248.67, and randomly
would exceed this value 50.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4936 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.143269492 (error 0.05 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000439 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
