Entropy = 7.999983 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 11466000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 11466000 samples is 264.68, and randomly
would exceed this value 50.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4712 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141818943 (error 0.01 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000126 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
